# PCNjoy
A PCN Cycling Trip Planner

## About The Project
With an increasing uptake due to the COVID-19 pandemic, cycling has become a popular option for leisure and commute. However, with 560 serious road cycling accidents a year on average (source: The Straits Times), a stigma against road cycling has formed, both by drivers and cyclists. 
Singapore has an extensive Park Connector Network (PCNs) of over 300km in length, which connect state-managed parks across the island. With dedicated cycling paths, PCNs are a viable and much safer option for cyclists compared to using roads and sidewalks. 
However, popular navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze are not catered to the local PCN infrastructure, and will oftentimes recommend routes that use roads rather than PCNs to cyclists. As such, leveraging on the government maintained OneMap routing service API, our app aims to allow users to find cycling routes that maximise the use of PCNs, while exploring new routes and local landmarks. 
In line with the government's plans to further expand and enhance PCNs, PCNjoy aims to become the one-stop trip planning app for recreational and commuting cyclists alike.
